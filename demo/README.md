# FlitDB
## Demo
What does this demo do?
This demo writes multiple values to the database, and then reads them all back to the user. Additionally, some of the values that are stored in the database, are then removed towards the end of the demo.
## Prerequisites
For this demo to officially work; you must have the following installed:

 - GCC
 - Make

Take note that this demo - as of the time last updated - is only tested on a Linux system.
## How to run
To run this demo, simply make sure that you've navigated into this directory ([`demo`](.)), then to compile the demo, you may simply type the following command into your terminal:

	make

Additionally, if you wish to compile the demo with a shared FlitDB library; then use the command:

	make lib

To run your program, simply type:

	make run

All versions of the commands entered about, will result in the same output from the program; but both compilations employ different ways for the program to interact with the FlitDB program, either as a: shared library, or to have the entire FlitDB source compiled into the standalone program.

For more specific commands attributed to the Makefile, please reference the table below:

| Command | What is does |
|---------|--------------|
|`make setup`|Creates the directory `build` in this folder, and copies over all the required FlitDB files from the folder [`../flitdb`](../flitdb).|
|`make setup_lib`|Creates the directory `build` in this folder.|
|`make build`|Will attempt to compile to program.|
|`make build_lib`|Will attempt to compile to program with a linked FlitDB shared library.|
|`make run`|Attempts to run the compiled program.|
|`make clean`|Removes all of the files and folders generated by `make setup`.|
